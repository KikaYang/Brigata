# Brigata â€” DHDK 2025
group: Members of the Brigata Â  

## Project GoalÂ  

The goal of the project is to integrate and query scholarly journal metadata using both a **relational database** and a **graph database**, and to implement a **query engine** capable of returning results as Python objects. The overall architecture is modular and supports handlers for uploading and querying data from heterogeneous sources.

---

## Data Sources

- **CSV (graph database)**: journal metadata from [DOAJ](https://doaj.org/)
- **JSON (relational database)**: category and area information from [Scimago Journal Rank](https://www.scimagojr.com/)
  
Each dataset has been normalized and loaded into its respective database type through custom upload handlers.

1. **CategoryUploadHandler** loads JSON data into the **relational database** (SQLite).Â  
2. **JournalUploadHandler** loads CSV data into the **graph database** (RDF triples or Neo4j-like structure).
3. **CategoryQueryHandler** and **JournalQueryHandler** retrieve relevant data as Pandas DataFrames.
4. **FullQueryEngine** integrates the data from both sources and transforms it into Python objects.

   The structure of relational database:

## Python Data Model

We defined three core entities:

- `Journal` with metadata like `title`, `language`, `license`, `apc`, `hasCategory`, `hasArea`
- `Category` with `id` and `quartile`
- `Area` with `id`

All classes extend from the abstract `IdentifiableEntity`.

---

## Query Engine Functionality

Implemented in two levels:

- `BasicQueryEngine`: simple filters such as title, license, seal, APC, quartile
- `FullQueryEngine`: composite queries combining multiple sources, such as:
  - Journals in specific **categories** and **quartiles**
  - Journals in specific **areas** and with a given **license**
  - **Diamond Open Access** journals matching multiple conditionsÂ

## How to Run the ProjectðŸš€

### 1. Project Setup

First, download all the python files and organize them in a folder with the following structure:

```
your_project/
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py    
â”œâ”€â”€ impl.py    
â”œâ”€â”€ baseHandler.py           
â”œâ”€â”€ daniele.py
â”œâ”€â”€ li.py 
â”œâ”€â”€ Yang.py 
â”œâ”€â”€ laura.py 
â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ XX.csv              
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ XXX.json            
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...                 # additional .csv or .json files
â””â”€â”€ relational.db             # (auto-generated, no need to create manually)
```

**Important**: Create a `data/` folder and place your query files inside. Only **CSV** and **JSON** file formats are supported.

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages if they're not already in your environment:

```bash
pip install pandas pyparsing rdflib SPARQLWrapper sqlalchemy
```

To check which packages you already have installed:
```bash
pip list
```

### 3. Setup Blazegraph

Activate Blazegraph in a separate terminal window:

**Download Blazegraph** (if you don't have it):
```bash
wget https://github.com/blazegraph/database/releases/download/BLAZEGRAPH_2_1_6_RC/blazegraph.jar
```

**Start Blazegraph**:
```bash
java -server -Xmx1g -jar blazegraph.jar
```
*Make sure the path to the JAR file is correct.*

**Verify Blazegraph is running** by visiting `http://localhost:9999/blazegraph/` in your browser.

### 4. Run the Project

Once all dependencies are installed and Blazegraph is running, you can execute the project by run the main.py.
```bash
python main.py
```
